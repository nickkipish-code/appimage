# Cursor Rules for n8n MCP Integration

This project includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for n8n integration.

## MCP Server Configuration

The MCP server is located at `mcp-server.js` and provides tools for:
- Listing n8n workflows
- Executing workflows
- Getting workflow status
- Triggering webhooks

## Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file:
- `N8N_API_URL` - Your n8n instance URL (default: http://localhost:5678)
- `N8N_API_KEY` - Your n8n API key (optional, but recommended)

## Running the MCP Server

```bash
npm run mcp
```

The server communicates via stdio and is designed to be used with Cursor Mobile's MCP integration.
